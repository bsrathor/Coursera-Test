<div class ="container">
	<div class="box1">
		<p class="fps">FPS</p>
		<p>
			Whatever random fps games that you play are better than whatever random games that others play for fun. As long as the game is story driven and action packed it'll be fun to play for long hours. There will not be much replaybility though.
		</p>
	</div>
	<div class="box2">
		<p class="strat">Strategy</p>
		<p>
			One of the most addictive games that I've played have always been strategy games. Hours and hours of gameplay and one always ends up wanting for just one more go at the next quest or goal in-game. Very entertaining but will make your eyes sore. 
		</p>	
	</div>
	<div class="box3">
		<p class="sport">Sports</p>
		<p>
			The kind of games that are not so popular but have been around always. My personal preference is not into sports based games but can give it a go sometime. Best to have a friend play with / against you else it can get pretty boring.
